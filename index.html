    <p>On 24th May I gave a talk at <a href="http://thundercloud.eventbrite.com/">Thundercloud London</a> called 'Thinking about giving'. If you're reading this, you were hopefully there. I said in a week's time, on June 1st, I would <strong>give &pound;50 away to the charity of your choice</strong>. Thank you for coming to take part! Below are further resources on charity evaluation and top rated charities, as well as the all-important info on how to vote.</p>
    <p><strong>Please <em><u>don't</u></em> share this link.</strong> It's meant for the attendees of the talk, not the wider internet. If you'd like the list to share, just let me know.</p>
